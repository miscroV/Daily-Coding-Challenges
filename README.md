# Daily-Coding-Challenges
Daily coding challenge solutions.

## Purpose
Using this repo to really get used to the git workflow. Every new challenge 
I will make a new branch to create the new challenge, add tests and docs, 
then make a pull request and merge my solution to main. 

## structure
Each challenge source has a folder containing a src file and tests file.
This way I can build unit tests as I create solution to problems. Python
will usually use pytest.
